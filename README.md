# Comprehensive-Financial-Analytics-Tesla-and-GameStop-Stocks-Revenues

## Problem Statement
This project aims to develop a comprehensive financial insights dashboard that provides an in-depth analysis of Tesla and GameStop's stock prices and quarterly revenue data. The project involves extracting, processing, and visualizing financial data using various Python libraries and techniques. The ultimate goal is to create interactive dashboards that present the extracted data in a user-friendly and insightful manner, allowing users to understand the financial performance of these two companies over time.

The first part of the project focuses on extracting historical stock price data for Tesla and GameStop using the yfinance library. This involves downloading the stock data, storing it in a DataFrame, and verifying its accuracy. Additionally, the project involves web scraping to extract quarterly revenue data for both companies from a financial website. This process includes fetching webpage content using requests, parsing the HTML with BeautifulSoup, and isolating the relevant tables to extract date and revenue information, which is then stored in DataFrames.

The second part of the project involves creating interactive dashboards to visualize the extracted stock price and revenue data. Using data visualization libraries like plotly or matplotlib, the project will generate line charts for stock prices and bar charts for revenue over time. These charts will be integrated into cohesive, interactive dashboards that provide a clear and comprehensive view of Tesla and GameStop's financial performance. The completed assignment will be documented and shared on GitHub, showcasing the full process from data extraction to visualization. This project not only enhances technical skills in data extraction and visualization but also provides valuable insights into the financial trends of two prominent companies.
